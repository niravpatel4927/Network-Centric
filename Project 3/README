In order to run this, first call make. Then have 2 terminals. One terminal will run the server using ./server 90
Then the other terminal will run ./proxy 8080 no_thread or ./proxy 8080 thread. This will cause both to run with and wait for the web browser. 

The proxy.c file looks for 3 arguments, with the third argument being no_thread or thread. This is so the code knows whether to use threads or processes. 
Run the web browser with 127.0.0.1:8080 to connect. This will cause the message to print to the screen. 

This will also cause it to be written into the log file.
