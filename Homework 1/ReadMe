This program creates a child process in order to compute the sum of 1 to 100. 

In order to make this file, first call 'make' in order to compile the code. 
Then call ./homework1 to run the code. The code will output the sum of 1 to 100,
which is 5050. 

This program uses a pipe to communicate between the child and the parent process. 
After the child computes the sum, it sends the sum to the parent to finish the rest
of the computation.
