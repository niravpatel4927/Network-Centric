This code takes 4 threads to compute the sum of 1-100. The threads get created, with a different structure holding 
the thread number, as well as the starting and ending values to compute in the sum function. The sum function goes through
the starting number to the ending number and computes it. The thread then returns that value and will print the sum of 1-100.
