The reason that the runtime for the system calls is so long is because standard I/O reads the data into a large buffer, allowing it
to perform input and output in fixed, easy to compute, sized chunks. This also means that a system call does not need to be made every time,
meaning that the program can be run much faster. Because standard I/O is buffered, it uses the minimum amount of read and write calls. 

System calls are unbuffered I/O, meaning that each read or write invokes a system call to the kernel. Because the kernel is the lowest
level, each read and write that occurs takes substantially more time than standard I/O calls, which is the result we see above.
